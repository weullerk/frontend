# Meep
> Welcome to the Meep frontend test.

The purpose of this repository is to test your skills.

## Getting started

This repository contains three modules, dashboard, form, and list. You must model these components according to the design that is in the Layouts folder.

What is most important in each module:

    - Dashboard:
        - Navigation.
    - Form:
        - Select the image and crop.
        - Mask.
    - List:
        - Infinite Scroll.

You will be evaluated by the organization and quality of the code. Also time is very important. Feel free to submit as many modules as you want, the more modules, the more points, but do not forget the time.

You should hold a fork of the repository and submit a pull request.

Good Luck :four_leaf_clover:
